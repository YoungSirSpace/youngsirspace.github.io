# My Trip to Japan (Part 1)

*28 December, 2025*

I plan to record my trip to Japan in the following articles.

My trip was not on a whim, it was carefully planned for a long time. When I was a primary school student, I stared dreaming a trip to Japan. I put myself into planning my trip as soon as I finished Gaokao, an important examination for most Chinese. I applied for visa successfully, after exchanging for Japanese yen and getting a Visa card, I boarded the fight to Japan. 

My first station is Osaka. Just after checking in, I came to the Shinsaibashi, where the famous billboard of Glico located.
