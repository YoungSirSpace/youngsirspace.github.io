        <div class="post-content">
          <p>As a pure beginner of computer science, just after entering the university and starting my study, I was badly hit by the course. Meanwhile, I found that many of my classmates can get great scores with little study, which breaks my spirit <em>again</em>.</p>
          <p>In that case, I am pretty depressed, wondering whether I am not suitable for computer science.</p>
          <p>Then, after the mid-term exam, our computer courcse teacher was changed. Our new teacher, whose given name was Li, told us that it was perfectly normal to feel depressed when learning computer science. He recommended us to write personal study notes, no matter right or false, just record the thought of ourselves.</p>
          <p>I plan to do so.</p>
          <p>At th beginning, I planned to write my thounghs on Twitter.</p>
          <p>Then, I found a serious problem. There is a maximum length of a single post without Prerium. Although I can reply myself to make it seems like a single article, but I cannot really stand.</p>
          <p>Something occurred to me at that time. I recalled a senior of my high school, who is majoring electronic engineering at Tsinghua University right now. I found his GitHub profile, and clicked the link to his

              <strong>personal blog website</strong>
            </a>. As I supposed, he would upload some of his study notes here. That how I think a personal blog website will be used for a student. It inspired me a lot. From then on, I determined to built a blog website. Not only can I write my notes here, but I can also write some book reviews for recording. Also, I am wondering whether the website can be a repository for my files. I will keep on trying.</p>
          <p>That's why I built this website. I found that I had a great interest in building a website, which brought the happiness of coding back for me.</p>
          <p>Hope this website can be a <strong>oasis</strong> for me.</p>
