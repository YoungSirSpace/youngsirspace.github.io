# Article 1 – Why I Built This Website?

*20 December, 2025*

As a pure beginner in computer science, just after entering the university and starting my study, I was badly hit by the course. Meanwhile, I found that many of my classmates could get great scores with little study, which broke my spirit again.

In that case, I was pretty depressed, wondering whether I was not suitable for computer science.

Then, after the mid-term exam, our computer course teacher was changed. Our new teacher, whose surname was Li, told us that it was perfectly normal to feel depressed when learning computer science. He recommended us to write personal study notes, no matter right or false, just record our own thoughts.

I planned to do so.

At the beginning, I planned to write my thoughts on Twitter.

Then, I found a serious problem. There is a maximum length for a single post without Premium. Although I could reply to myself to make it seem like a single article, I could not really stand it.

Something occurred to me at that time. I recalled a senior from my high school, who is majoring in electronic engineering at Tsinghua University right now. I found his GitHub profile, and clicked the link to his [**personal blog website**](https://blog.konpoku.top/). As I supposed, he uploaded some of his study notes there. That is how I think a personal blog website will be used for a student. It inspired me a lot. From then on, I determined to build a blog website. Not only could I write my notes here, but I could also write some book reviews for recording. Also, I was wondering whether the website could be a repository for my files. I will keep on trying.

That's why I built this website. I found that I had a great interest in building a website, which brought the happiness of coding back to me.

Hope this website can be an **oasis** for me.
