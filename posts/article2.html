    <p>I am going to write some of my concerns here. It is a bit like a word in Chinese internet called "jianzheng (键政)", which means discussing the politics throungh typing on the keyboard.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>My top concern is meant for career. Under this recessionary circumstances, no one can guarantee they will find a satisfactory job. Even worse, they might not be able to find work at all. Although I often comfort myself by saying that, "I am a student of C9 universities, if I fail to find a job, there will be few people can find a work", I am really nervous about my future. Even though I find a job successfully, I cannot sure whether it can make my ends meet, or affort my costly lifestyle. My ideal lifestyle includes being able to travel around the world, working in the big cities, and having some valuable properties. However, it is really hard to meet the standard, like an ethereal dream.</p>
    <p>How to dissolve my concerns? Just struggle studying and working, I think. I don't know whether it can work, but it is the best way I can thingk of.</p>
    <h2>Studies</h2>
    <p>As I wrote in my first post, I have encountered many problems in my studies.</p>
